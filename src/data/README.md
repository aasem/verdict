# Verdict Game Logic

## Scoring Parameters
The game uses 9 universal traits to track player decisions:

1. **judgment** - Decision-making quality and wisdom
2. **stability** - Maintaining order and preventing chaos
3. **agency** - Taking initiative and responsibility
4. **trust** - Building and maintaining trust
5. **integrity** - Moral and ethical consistency
6. **impact** - Consequences of decisions
7. **clarity** - Communication and transparency
8. **alignment** - Consistency with values and goals
9. **publicApproval** - Public perception and support

## Effect Sizes
Each choice's impact on trait is categorized by magnitude:

| Label | Value Range | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| ðŸ”µ Minor | Â±1 | Soft influence |
| ðŸŸ¡ Moderate | Â±2 | Strategic consequence |
| ðŸ”´ Major | Â±3 | Significant trade-off |

## Trait Mapping
Final trait scores are mapped to player characteristics and used for profile generation:

| Score Range  | Label             | Use for Profiles                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **â‰¥ +8**     | Dominant Trait    | Core profile definer â€” used to match main identity    |
| **+6 to +7** | Strong Trait      | Supporting traits â€” refines profile or adds nuance    |
| **0 to +5** | Neutral Trait     | Balanced trait â€” no strong influence on profile       |
| **-1 to -5** | Weak Trait        | Adds flaw tags or mild limitations                    |
| **â‰¤ -6**     | Critical Weakness | Excludes certain profiles or triggers major flaw tags |


## Profile Assignments
Based on trait scores, players are assigned one of the following profiles. The profile is determined by the highest scoring trait that is either Dominant (â‰¥ +8) or Strong (â‰¥ +6). If no trait meets this threshold, the player is assigned "The Generalist" profile.

### The Generalist
If no trait scores reach the Strong threshold (â‰¥ +6), the player is assigned "The Generalist" profile:
"You're balanced and versatile. No single trait dominates, and that's a strength too."

## Scoring Rules
- Each choice affects all nine traits
- Trait scores range from -3 to +3
- Final scores are cumulative across all scenarios
- No overall score is calculated; each trait is tracked separately

## Game Flow
1. 90-second time limit
2. Random scenario selection (no repeats)
3. Player makes choice
4. Effects are applied to all traits
5. Next scenario is presented
6. Game ends when time runs out
7. Final scores show cumulative effect on each trait
